        "explanation": "Static friction prevents relative motion. If you push a box on a truck and the truck accelerates, static friction from the truck pushes the box forward (positive work). If you walk, static friction pushes you forward (positive work). If an object is held stationary on an incline by static friction, displacement is zero, work done is zero. Work done *by* static friction is often zero in simple textbook cases where it just prevents slipping, but it *can* do work."
